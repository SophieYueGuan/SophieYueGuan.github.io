Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently an associate professor at School of Economics and Management, Communication University of China. I got my PhD degree from School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. My research focuses on the application of multi-modal data (images, texts, etc) in recommender system design and platform governence. By combining multiple methods and techniques, I am interested in the value of artificial intelligence and multi-modal data in addressing problems in platform management.

If you have interesting ideas or thoughts, feel free to share with me! (yueguan@cuc.edu.cn)
